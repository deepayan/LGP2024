# Data Visualization

* Important tool to understand data

--

* Main purposes

	- Exploration

	- Presentation

---

# Today's goals

- Learn what kind of visualizations we can use

- How to create them uisng R

---

layout: false

# Example datasets: `airquality` (size: small)

```{r}
str(airquality) # built-in dataset
```

???

The first dataset we will consider is a simple built-in dataset in R,

- giving daily air quality measurements in New York City,

- over five months in 1973.

It has 153 observations, one for each day from May through September.

---

# Example datasets: `airquality` (size: small)

```{r}
head(airquality, 15)
```

???

There are some NA values, which indicate missing data.

Also notice that dates are specified separately in MONTH and DAY
columns, and MONTH is indicated by number rather than name.

---

# Example datasets: `NHANES` (size: somewhat large)

.scrollable500[

```{r}
library(package = "NHANES")
str(NHANES)
```

]

???

Data originally come from a health and nutrition survey conducted regularly in the USA.

Each row in this dataset represents a respondent in the study.

The actual study uses a fairly complex survey design.

This is not the full dataset, but rather a carefully chosen subset that can be treated as a _random sample_ from the US population.

---

# The goal of data visualization

* Visualizations help us study relationships

* This is enabled by comparison


???

visual comparisons require the data values being plotted to be
converted into something that _can_ be plotted.

The most common and obvious mapping is from a value to a _coordinate
position_ on the plot.

But the mapping can also be to _length_, _area_, or even
_color_.

We will see some of these mappings in the examples that follow.

---

# What do we study using visualization?

- Univariate distributions

- Bivariate and trivariate (generally multivariate) relationships

- Special case: Relationship with time (time-series) or space (spatial)

???

Let us now dive into some visualization _examples_, keeping our earlier discussion in mind.

We will start with a simple univariate data vector, namely, the vector of ozone concentrations in the AIR QUALITY data set.

---

# The `plot()` function

```{r}
plot(airquality$Ozone)
```

---

layout: true

# Univariate distributions: strip charts or dot plots

---

```{r}
stripchart(airquality$Ozone)
```

---

```{r}
stripchart(airquality$Ozone, method = "stack", pch = 16)
```

---

layout: true

# Univariate distributions: comparative strip charts

---

```{r}
stripchart(Ozone ~ factor(Month), data = airquality, method = "stack", pch = 16)
```

---

```{r}
airquality$Month <- factor(airquality$Month, labels = month.abb[5:9])
stripchart(Temp ~ Month, data = airquality, method = "stack", pch = 16)
```

---

```{r}
stripchart(DirectChol ~ Gender, data = NHANES, method = "jitter", pch = 16)
```

---

```{r}
stripchart(DirectChol ~ Gender, data = NHANES, method = "jitter", pch = 16, col = rgb(0, 0, 0, alpha = 0.1))
```

---

layout: true

# Univariate distributions: comparative box and whisker plots

---

```{r fig.height=5}
boxplot(DirectChol ~ Gender, data = NHANES, horizontal = TRUE, range = 0)
```

---

```{r fig.height=5}
boxplot(DirectChol ~ Gender, data = NHANES, horizontal = TRUE)
```

---

```{r fig.height=5}
library(package = "lattice")
bwplot(Gender ~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES)
```

---

layout: false

# Univariate distributions: comparative histograms

```{r}
histogram( ~ BPSysAve | Gender, data = NHANES, layout = c(1, 2), nint = 25)
```

---

# Univariate distributions: comparative box plots

```{r}
bwplot(Race1 ~ Weight | Gender, data = NHANES)
```

???

Notice that in the last two plots, we have used a combination of two
grouping attributes to separate the data, race and gender, using
conditioning, along with the usual comparative boxplot design.

This kind of comparison among subgroups is something that a
well-designed plot can convey very effectively.

For example, this plot suggests that weight distribution varies across
racial subgroups, and the pattern of changes is largely the same for
males and females, except for blacks.

# Summary: Univariate distributions

* Basic design: Strip charts

* Generalizations: box and whisker plots, histograms

---

# Bivariate distributions: scatter plot

* Encodes two variables as x- and y-coordinates

```{r,fig.height=5}
plot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality)
```

---


# Bivariate distributions: scatter plot

```{r}
xyplot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality, grid = TRUE)
```

---

# Bivariate distributions: comparative scatter plots


```{r}
xyplot(Ozone ~ Solar.R | Month, data = airquality, grid = TRUE, layout = c(5, 1), pch = 16)
```

---

# Bivariate distributions: semi-transparent colors

```{r}
xyplot(Weight ~ Height | Gender, data = NHANES, grid = TRUE, pch = 16, alpha = 0.1)
```

---

layout: true

# Our survey data

---

```{r}
lgp <- read.csv("https://deepayan.github.io/LGP2024/slides/data/lgp-survey.csv")
str(lgp)
```

---

```{r, fig.height=6}
xyplot(Height_Father ~ Height_Mother, data = lgp, grid = TRUE)
```

---

```{r, fig.height=6}
xyplot(Height_Father ~ Height_Mother, data = lgp, grid = TRUE, abline = c(0, 1), jitter.x = TRUE, jitter.y = TRUE)

```{r, fig.height=6}
xyplot(Height_Self ~ Height_Mother | HasY, data = lgp, grid = TRUE, abline = c(0, 1))
```

---

```{r, fig.height=6}
xyplot(Height_Self ~ Height_Father | HasY, data = lgp, grid = TRUE, abline = c(0, 1))
```

<img style="width: 30%; float: right" src="images/dress.jpg"></img>

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress, data = lgp)
```


--

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress + BirthdayOddEven, data = lgp)
```

--

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress + HasY, data = lgp)
```

---

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress, data = lgp)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress + BirthdayOddEven, data = lgp) |> prop.table(margin = 2) |> round(digits = 2)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ Dress + HasY, data = lgp) |> prop.table(margin = 2) |> round(digits = 2)
```

---

```{r}
xtabs(~ BirthMonth, data = lgp) |> sort() |> barchart()
```

* What formal questions can we pose after seeing these summaries?

* Will discuss tomorrow
