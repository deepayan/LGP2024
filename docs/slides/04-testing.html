# Hypothesis Testing

* Formal process to ask and answer questions

--

* Conjecture ("null hypothesis"): observed data come from a specified probability model

* Test: Is observed data "plausible" if the model is correct?

--

* The model is usually a simple __abstraction__ of reality

---

# Example: The dress

```r
lgp <- read.csv("https://deepayan.github.io/LGP2024/slides/data/lgp-survey.csv")
xtabs(~ Dress, data = lgp)
```

```
Dress
Blue and Black White and Gold 
            33             38 
```

--

* Define "Blue and Black" to be success

* Assume $n = 71$ independent trials, each with success probability $p$

* Is this is a reasonable model?

--

* Observation: $X = 33$

* What are "plausible" values of $p$?

--

* Remember: Distribution of $X$
$$
P(X = k) = { n \choose k } \, p^k \, (1-p)^{n - k}\,, \, k = 0, 1, 2, \dotsc, n
$$

---

* Is $p = 0.1$ plausible?

# Confidence intervals

---

* The red regions are known as __confidence intervals__ for $p$

* The associated confidence level is __90%__

--

* Thankfully, the confidence intervals for "odd" and "even" overlap!

* So it is _plausible_ that a common value of $p$ gave rise to the observed data

--

* There is of course a built-in function to do something like this in R

* This function is called `binom.test()`

---


```r
binom.test(12, 32)
```

```

	Exact binomial test

data:  12 and 32
number of successes = 12, number of trials = 32, p-value = 0.2153
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.2110003 0.5630775
sample estimates:
probability of success 
                 0.375

# Permutation tests

---

* What we have just done is a _model-based_ test

* This is not the only possible abstraction for our problem

--

* Another interesting approach gives rise to a permutation test

* Abstract conjecture: _NOT_ Binomial, instead...

--

	* Fixed sample — those who filled up the survey

	* Response to the dress question is fixed (not random)

	* Odd-Even label was randomly assigned


--

* Is this a reasonable abstraction?

--

* If yes, permuting Odd-Even labels should generate another "random" table from same distribution

* We can apply the same idea to heights of your parents




```r

```

* What happens if we pair up the same set of heights randomly?


```r
xyplot(sample(Height_Father) ~ Height_Mother, data = lgp,
       grid = TRUE, abline = c(0, 1), jitter.x = TRUE, jitter.y = TRUE)

* This is our abstract model for the conjecture that parents' heights are "independent"

* Same approach as before, with $X = $ number of pairs with mother taller than father


```r

replicate(100, with(lgpOK, sum( sample(Height_Father) < Height_Mother )))
```

* If our conjecture / hypothesis is __true__, the chance of seeing $X = 0$ is


```r
sum(X.rand == 0) / length(X.rand)
```

```
[1] 0.00701
```

* This is _very small_, so the conjecture of independence is __not plausible__

--

* So we __reject__ the conjecture of independence

--

* None of these results are surprising
	
* But it is reassuring to see that a formal mathematical approach agrees with our intuition

# Goodness of Fit test

* Finally, what about `BirthMonth` ?


```r
xtabs(~ BirthMonth, data = lgp)
```

```
BirthMonth
    April    August  December  February   January      July      June     March 
        8         7         6         4         7         6         6         5 
      May  November   October September 
        2         9         8         3 
```

--

* This case is unfortunately not that simple

* The main issue is: What measurement should we use as the random variable $X$?

--

* There is a standard answer which is difficult to justify: the $\chi^2$ goodness of fit test

---

* Let us first put the table in correct order


```r
mtab <- xtabs(~ factor(BirthMonth, levels = month.name), data = lgp)
mtab
```

```
factor(BirthMonth, levels = month.name)
  January  February     March     April       May      June      July    August 
        7         4         5         8         2         6         6         7 
September   October  November  December 
        3         8         9         6 
```

--


```r
chisq.test(mtab, p = c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31) / 365)
```

```

	Chi-squared test for given probabilities

data:  mtab
X-squared = 8.1106, df = 11, p-value = 0.7034
```

* Basically, this says that what we observe is very plausible if all birthdays are equally likely

* However, we could well have come to a different conclusion if we had a lot more data
